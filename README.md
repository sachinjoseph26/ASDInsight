# ASDInsight

## Project Overview

### This project aims to enhance the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Canadian children using machine learning techniques. By addressing the primary challenges in ASD diagnosis, such as comorbidities, confusion with other disabilities etc we aim to improve early intervention and developmental outcomes. The project focuses on developing machine learning models for predictive modeling based on questionnaires, eye-tracking data analysis for identifying social attention deficits, and automated behavioral analysis through video processing.

### Goals

- Increase the percentage of children diagnosed with ASD by age 4 from the current 53.7% to 90%.
- Diagnose ASD and generate interventions recommendations based on the diagnosis

### Key Components

1. **Predictive Modeling for Early Diagnosis Based on Questionnaires**
2. **Eye-Tracking Data Analysis for Identifying Social Attention Deficits**
3. **Automated Behavioral Analysis through Video Processing**

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Virtual environment  (recommended)
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
